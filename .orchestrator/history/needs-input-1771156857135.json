  "question": "Ready to start implementing grid trading strategy (from task.json). This is a significant feature — new GridStrategy class, DB schema additions, config changes, backtest extension. Should I proceed with planning and implementation, or do you want to adjust the requirements first?",
  "context": "Project review complete. Base project (Phases 1-5) is stable and fully implemented: multi-indicator signal trading, risk management, paper/live modes, backtesting, SMS notifications, SQLite persistence. One post-launch bug fix applied. A new task is queued in .orchestrator/task.json requesting a grid trading strategy as a second strategy mode. No .planning/ directory exists yet for this new work.",
  "options": ["Proceed with grid trading implementation as specified", "Modify requirements first", "Skip grid trading — assign a different task"],
